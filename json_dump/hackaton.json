Ikari demonstrated that the fat acceptance movement was made possible not by a shared or solid political identity but through these affective interactions. Ikari could have described the lives of fat individuals in more detail rather than via abstract theoretical discussions. Instead Ikari describes the lives of fat activists in the United States in a limited and fragmented manner. Japanese readers, who may hardly ever see supersize women, would probably want to know more about what struggles these women have been through. These questions are critical to an understanding of the worldviews of activists; however, this ethnography barely answers them. This may be because Ikari admits feeling guilty about her body size, which was much thinner than the activists and so she was watching herself to check whether or not her comments and behaviors bothered the women. Additionally, she was often the only Asian woman among White activists. I am certain that a few detailed life stories of fat activists would make Japanese readers feel a greater affinity with the activists. Despite several weaknesses, however, Ikari grasps the uniqueness of fat in a thoughtprovoking manner. I hope that this ethnography will not be the end of her research so that Ikari will continue to report on the insights gained from fat activists to Japanese society, where \u201cobesity\u201d is also highly stigmatized.", "authors": [{"authorId": "15510707", "name": "Jenny Ellison"}]}, {"paperId": "44fe194abc8b1935addcd573acb7c1a21b2c9625", "title": "Mouse strain-dependent variation in obesity and glucose homeostasis in response to high-fat feeding", "abstract": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "32881213", "name": "M.

Between June 2010 and April 2011, 86 patients received a diagnosis of NAFLD. Ten patients did not accept liver biopsy and six patients had contraindications for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Seventy patients were included in this study. Seventy patients with NAFLD (40 men, 30 women; mean age, 44.7 years; range, 16-69 years) underwent T1-independent volumetric multiecho gradient-echo imaging with T2* correction and spectral fat modeling. Median time interval between MR imaging and liver biopsy was 14.5 days (range, 0-259 days). MR examinations were performed with a 1.5-T MR imaging system. Complex-based PDFF measurements were performed by placing regions of interest in Couinaud system segments V-VI and all liver segments from I to VIII. All liver biopsy specimens were retrieved from archives and evaluated by one pathologist for hepatic steatosis according to criteria from a previous study. Pearson correlation coefficient, receiver operating characteristics, and linear regression analyses were used for statistical analyses.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMean PDFF calculated with MR imaging was 18.1% \u00b1 9.5 (standard deviation). Close correlation for quantification of hepatic steatosis was observed between PDFF and liver biopsy (r = 0.82). PDFF was effective in discriminating moderate or severe hepatic steatosis from mild or no hepatic steatosis, with area under the curve of 0.95. The correlation between biopsy and PDFF-determined steatosis was less pronounced when fibrosis was present (r = 0.60) than when fibrosis was absent (r = 0.86; P = .02).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPDFF measurement by MR imaging provided a noninvasive, accurate estimation of the presence and grading of hepatic steatosis in patients with NAFLD.

In myopathies and muscle atrophy associated with aging, fat accumulation increases dysfunction, and after chronic injury, the process of fatty degeneration, in which muscle is replaced by white adipocytes, further compromises tissue function and environment. Some studies suggest that pericytes may contribute to muscle regeneration as well as fat formation. This work reports the presence of two pericyte subpopulations in the skeletal muscle and characterizes their specific roles. Skeletal muscle from Nestin-GFP/NG2-DsRed mice show two types of pericytes, Nestin-GFP-/NG2-DsRed+ (type-1) and Nestin-GFP+/NG2-DsRed+ (type-2), in close proximity to endothelial cells. We also found that both Nestin-GFP-/NG2-DsRed+ and Nestin-GFP+/NG2-DsRed+ cells colocalize with staining of two pericyte markers, PDGFR\u03b2 and CD146, but only type-1 pericyte express the adipogenic progenitor marker PDGFR\u03b1. Type-2 pericytes participate in muscle regeneration, while type-1 contribute to fat accumulation. Transplantation studies indicate that type-1 pericytes do not form muscle in vivo, but contribute to fat deposition in the skeletal muscle, while type-2 pericytes contribute only to the new muscle formation after injury, but not to the fat accumulation. Our results suggest that type-1 and type-2 pericytes contribute to successful muscle regeneration which results from a balance of myogenic and nonmyogenic cells activation.", "authors": [{"authorId": "4690706", "name": "A.

Incorporation of selective fat compartment volume restoration along with superficial musculoaponeurotic system manipulation allows for improved control in recontouring while addressing one of the key problems in facial aging, namely, volume deflation. This theory was evaluated by assessing the contour changes from simultaneous face \u201clifting\u201d and \u201cfilling\u201d through fat compartment\u2013guided facial fat transfer. Methods: A review of 100 face-lift patients was performed. All patients had an individualized component face lift with fat grafting to the nasolabial fold, deep malar, and high/lateral malar fat compartment locations. Photographic analysis using a computer program was conducted on oblique facial views preoperatively and postoperatively, to obtain the most projected malar contour point. Two independent observers visually evaluated the malar prominence and nasolabial fold improvements based on standardized photographs. Results: Nasolabial fold improved by at least one grade in 81 percent and by over one grade in 11 percent. Malar prominence average projection increase was 13.47 percent and the average amount of lift was 12.24 percent. The malar prominence score improved by at least one grade in 62 percent of the patients postoperatively, and 9 percent had a greater than one grade improvement. Twenty-eight percent of the patients had a convex malar prominence postoperatively compared with 6 percent preoperatively. Malar prominence improved by at least one grade in 63 percent and by over one grade in 10 percent. Conclusions: The lift-and-fill face lift merges two key concepts in facial rejuvenation: (1) effective tissue manipulation by means of lifting and tightening in differential vectors according to original facial asymmetry and shape; and (2) selective fat compartment filling of deep malar and high malar locations and nasolabial fold fat grafting to precisely control facial contouring.

Fat loss occurs in both visceral and subcutaneous depots; however, the pattern of loss has been incompletely characterized.

Thus, it is important to understand adipose development and function. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3) is widely believed to be the master regulator of adipocyte biology. Surprisingly, however, previous studies attempting to delete the PPAR\u03b3 gene specifically in mouse adipose tissue did not demonstrate a dramatic phenotype. By using newer methods, the present study reports that fat-specific loss of PPAR\u03b3 causes dramatic loss of adipose tissue, severe insulin resistance and diabetes, fatty liver, and abnormalities of bone, skin, and mammary glands, all of which contain adipose tissue. We show that adipocyte PPAR\u03b3 is required for normal fat development and metabolic function in vivo. Adipose tissue is an important metabolic organ, the dysfunction of which is associated with the development of obesity, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease. The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3) is considered the master regulator of adipocyte differentiation and function. Although its cell-autonomous role in adipogenesis has been clearly demonstrated in cell culture, previous fat-specific knockouts of the murine PPAR\u03b3 gene did not demonstrate a dramatic phenotype in vivo. Here, using Adipoq\u2013Cre mice to drive adipose-specific recombination, we report a unique fat-specific PPAR\u03b3 knockout (PPAR\u03b3 FKO) mouse model with almost no visible brown and white adipose tissue at age 3 mo. As a consequence, PPAR\u03b3 FKO mice had hugely enlarged pancreatic islets, massive fatty livers, and dramatically elevated levels of blood glucose and serum insulin accompanied by extreme insulin resistance. PPAR\u03b3 FKO mice also exhibited delayed hair coat formation associated with absence of dermal fat, disrupted mammary gland development with loss of mammary fat pads, and high bone mass with loss of bone marrow fat, indicating the critical roles of adipose PPAR\u03b3 in these tissues.

Current evidence suggests, however, obesity itself is not an exclusive predictor of metabolic dysregulation but rather adipose tissue distribution. Obesity-related adverse health consequences occur predominately in individuals with upper body fat accumulation, the detrimental distribution, commonly associated with visceral obesity. Increased lower body subcutaneous adipose tissue, however, is associated with a reduced risk of obesity-induced metabolic dysregulation and even enhanced insulin sensitivity, thus, storage in this region is considered protective. The proposed mechanisms that causally relate the differential outcomes of adipose tissue distribution are often attributed to location and/or adipocyte regulation. Visceral adipose tissue effluent to the portal vein drains into the liver where hepatocytes are directly exposed to its metabolites and secretory products, whereas the subcutaneous adipose tissue drains systemically. Adipose depots are also inherently different in numerous ways such as adipokine release, immunity response and regulation, lipid turnover, rate of cell growth and death, and response to stress and sex hormones. Proximal extrinsic factors also play a role in the differential drive between adipose tissue depots.

(ii) A control group of 118 matched patients (two controls per lipofilling patient) with the corresponding recurrence-free intervals. Both groups were also matched for main cancer criteria. A local event (LE) was the primary end point, with follow-up starting from the baseline.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMedian follow-up was 63 and 66 months from surgery, and 38 and 42 from baseline, for the lipofilling and control groups, respectively; the 5-year cumulative incidence of LE was 18% and 3% (P = 0.02). Ki-67 was the significant factor in univariate survival analysis. A subgroup analysis showed that lipofilling increased the risk of LE in women <50 years, with high grade neoplasia, Ki-67 \u2265 14 or who had undergone quadrantectomy.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nHigher risk of LE was observed in intraepithelial neoplasia patients following lipofilling. Although further studies are required to validate our conclusions, patients belonging to this subgroup should be informed of these results and the potential risks.", "authors": [{"authorId": "36930853", "name": "J.

To determine what role CCR2 plays in the development of metabolic phenotypes, we studied the effects of Ccr2 genotype on the development of obesity and its associated phenotypes. Genetic deficiency in Ccr2 reduced food intake and attenuated the development of obesity in mice fed a high-fat diet. In obese mice matched for adiposity, Ccr2 deficiency reduced macrophage content and the inflammatory profile of adipose tissue, increased adiponectin expression, ameliorated hepatic steatosis, and improved systemic glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. In mice with established obesity, short-term treatment with a pharmacological antagonist of CCR2 lowered macrophage content of adipose tissue and improved insulin sensitivity without significantly altering body mass or improving hepatic steatosis.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We analyzed data from a cohort of 51,529 U.S. male health professionals, 40-75 years of age in 1986, who completed biennial questionnaires sent out in 1986, 1988, 1990, and 1992. During 5 years of follow-up (1987-1992), 272 cases of NIDDM were diagnosed among men without a history of diabetes, heart disease, and cancer in 1986 and who provided complete health information. Relative risks (RRs) associated with different anthropometrie measures were calculated controlling for age, and multivariate RRs were calculated controlling for smoking, family history of diabetes, and age. RESULTS We found a strong positive association between overall obesity as measured by body mass index (BMI) and risk of diabetes. Men with a BMI of \u226535 kg/m2 had a multivariate RR of 42.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 22.0-80.6) compared with men with a BMI <23.0 kg/m2. BMI at age 21 and absolute weight gain throughout adulthood were also significant independent risk factors for diabetes. Fat distribution, measured by waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), was a good predictor of diabetes only among the top 5%, while waist circumference was positively associated with the risk of diabetes among the top 20% of the cohort. CONCLUSIONS These data suggest that waist circumference may be a better indicator than WHR of the relationship between abdominal adiposity and risk of diabetes. Although early obesity, absolute weight gain throughout adulthood, and waist circumference were good predictors of diabetes, attained BMI was the dominant risk factor for NIDDM; even men of average relative weight had significantly elevated RRs.", "authors": [{"authorId": "145554525", "name": "J.

The hygiene hypothesis postulates that decreased microbial exposure has, in part, driven this immune dysregulation. However, dietary fatty acids also influence immunity, partially through modulation of responses to microbes. Prior reports have described the direct effects of high-fat diets on the gut microbiome and inflammation, and some have additionally shown metabolic consequences for offspring. Our study sought to expand on these previous observations to identify the effects of parental diet on offspring immunity using mouse models to provide insights into challenging aspects of human health. To test the hypothesis that parental dietary fat consumption during gestation and lactation influences offspring immunity, we compared pups of mice fed either a Western diet (WD) fatty acid profile or a standard low-fat diet. All pups were weaned onto the control diet to specifically test the effects of early developmental fat exposure on immune development. Pups from WD breeders were not obese or diabetic, but still had worse outcomes in models of infection, autoimmunity, and allergic sensitization. They had heightened colonic inflammatory responses, with increased circulating bacterial LPS and muted systemic LPS responsiveness. These deleterious impacts of the WD were associated with alterations of the offspring gut microbiome. These results indicate that parental fat consumption can leave a \u201clard legacy\u201d impacting offspring immunity and suggest inheritable microbiota may contribute to the modern patterns of human health and disease.", "authors": [{"authorId": "3616324", "name": "I.

High-sugar compared with high-fat equicaloric milkshakes caused greater activation in the bilateral insula extending into the putamen, the Rolandic operculum, and thalamus, which produced large activation regions.

Some critics of the campaign maintained that Lehtinen\u2019s communication lacked focus and was self-contradicting, especially concerning her wish to lose weight. I conducted discourse analysis of a pertinent element of the Scale Rebellion campaign, a 13-part column series called Jenny\u2019s Life Change, written by Lehtinen herself. The findings suggest that diverse, conflicting discourses on fatness are indeed present in her texts; of these, I have named anti-\u201cobesity,\u201d fatphobic, size acceptance, and societal discourses. However, in line with scholars such as Michalinos Zembylas, I argue that Lehtinen\u2019s conflicting messaging on fatness is not (only) an expression of her personal opinions but in fact linked to ambivalent fatness discourses circulating in Finnish society and abroad. Further, Samantha Murray has noted that fat activism would do well in welcoming the multivocality often present in (narratives on) fatness, since ambivalence might actually contain potential. One such possibility is the very observation that ambivalence vis-\u00e0-vis fatness is not necessarily a sign of being a sell-out or a \u201cfake\u201d fat activist. Instead, it is an indication that at a time when fatness is a stigmatized trait, almost everyone is exposed to conflicting messages about it. Therefore fat activists\u2019 ambivalence in relation to fatness should not be judged but rather seen in this larger context.", "authors": [{"authorId": "2079357218", "name": "Anna Puhakka"}]}, {"paperId": "8097447966c00c2c6c9058cd56e2e0f28d2424ca", "title": "Frozen: A fat tale of immigration", "abstract": "ABSTRACT Fat people are constructed as failed citizens; they are believed to be a burden on society, consuming too many resources and costing too many healthcare monies.

The authors recently observed that living and dead adipocytes can be differentiated not with hematoxylin and eosin staining but with immunohistochemistry for perilipin. Methods: The viability of cellular components (adipocytes, adipose stem/stromal/progenitor cells, vascular endothelial cells, and hematopoietic cells) in human adipose tissue was evaluated using (1) stored lipoaspirates, (2) cultured cells, and (3) organ-cultured adipose tissue. In addition, the groin fat pad (150 to 200 mg) in mice was transplanted under the scalp, and the graft was stained at 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, or 14 days. Results: In vitro studies revealed that adipocytes are most susceptible to death under ischemic conditions, although adipose-derived stromal cells can remain viable for 3 days. The in vivo study indicated that most adipocytes in the graft began to die on day 1, and only some of the adipocytes located within 300 &mgr;m of the tissue edge survived. The number of proliferating cells increased from day 3, and an increase in viable adipocyte area was detected from day 7, suggesting that repair/regeneration of the dead tissue had begun. Conclusions: The authors show convincing evidence of very dynamic remodeling of adipose tissue after nonvascularized grafting. The authors observed three zones from the periphery to the center of the graft: the surviving area (adipocytes survived), the regenerating area (adipocytes died, adipose-derived stromal cells survived, and dead adipocytes were replaced with new ones), and the necrotic area (both adipocytes and adipose-derived stromal cells died).", "authors": [{"authorId": "32638796", "name": "H.

The type of diet consumed is of major concern for the prevention and treatment of these diseases. Evidence from animal and human studies has shown that LPS can diffuse from the gut to the circulatory system in response to the intake of high amounts of fat. The method by which LPS move into the circulatory system is either through direct diffusion due to intestinal paracellular permeability or through absorption by enterocytes during chylomicron secretion. Considering the impact of metabolic diseases on public health and the association between these diseases and the levels of LPS in the circulatory system, this review will mainly discuss the current knowledge about high-fat diets and subclinical inflammation. It will also describe the new evidence that correlates gut microbiota, intestinal permeability and alkaline phosphatase activity with increased blood LPS levels and the biological effects of this increase, such as insulin resistance. Although the majority of the studies published so far have assessed the effects of dietary fat, additional studies are necessary to deepen the understanding of how the amount, the quality and the structure of the fat may affect endotoxaemia. The potential of food combinations to reduce the negative effects of fat intake should also be considered in future studies. In these studies, the effects of flavonoids, prebiotics and probiotics on endotoxaemia should be investigated. Thus, it is essential to identify dietetic strategies capable of minimising endotoxaemia and its postprandial inflammatory effects.", "authors": [{"authorId": "48815349", "name": "A.

Increased dietary n-6 PUFAs have, however, also been proposed to promote inflammation-a yet unproven theory.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nWe investigated the effects of PUFAs on liver fat, systemic inflammation, and metabolic disorders.\n\n\nDESIGN\nWe randomly assigned 67 abdominally obese subjects (15% had type 2 diabetes) to a 10-wk isocaloric diet high in vegetable n-6 PUFA (PUFA diet) or SFA mainly from butter (SFA diet), without altering the macronutrient intake. Liver fat was assessed by MRI and magnetic resonance proton (1H) spectroscopy (MRS). Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 (PCSK9, a hepatic LDL-receptor regulator), inflammation, and adipose tissue expression of inflammatory and lipogenic genes were determined.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 61 subjects completed the study. Body weight modestly increased but was not different between groups. Liver fat was lower during the PUFA diet than during the SFA diet [between-group difference in relative change from baseline; 16% (MRI; P < 0.001), 34% (MRS; P = 0.02)]. PCSK9 (P = 0.001), TNF receptor-2 (P < 0.01), and IL-1 receptor antagonist (P = 0.02) concentrations were lower during the PUFA diet, whereas insulin (P = 0.06) tended to be higher during the SFA diet. In compliant subjects (defined as change in serum linoleic acid), insulin, total/HDL-cholesterol ratio, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides were lower during the PUFA diet than during the SFA diet (P < 0.05). Adipose tissue gene expression was unchanged.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCompared with SFA intake, n-6 PUFAs reduce liver fat and modestly improve metabolic status, without weight loss. A high n-6 PUFA intake does not cause any signs of inflammation or oxidative stress. Downregulation of PCSK9 could be a novel mechanism behind the cholesterol-lowering effects of PUFAs.

How gene expression controls local cell mechanical properties to drive tissue deformation remains poorly understood. Bosveld et al. (p. 724, published online 12 April) have uncovered how the conserved Fat/Dachsous/Four-jointed signaling pathway controls local mechanical cell properties to generate global tissue contraction in Drosophila epithelial tissue. Polarized proto-cadherin and myosin induce an anisotropic tension at cell junctions and thereby shape epithelial tissue. During animal development, several planar cell polarity (PCP) pathways control tissue shape by coordinating collective cell behavior. Here, we characterize by means of multiscale imaging epithelium morphogenesis in the Drosophila dorsal thorax and show how the Fat/Dachsous/Four-jointed PCP pathway controls morphogenesis. We found that the proto-cadherin Dachsous is polarized within a domain of its tissue-wide expression gradient. Furthermore, Dachsous polarizes the myosin Dachs, which in turn promotes anisotropy of junction tension. By combining physical modeling with quantitative image analyses, we determined that this tension anisotropy defines the pattern of local tissue contraction that contributes to shaping the epithelium mainly via oriented cell rearrangements. Our results establish how tissue planar polarization coordinates the local changes of cell mechanical properties to control tissue morphogenesis.", "authors": [{"authorId": "2181595", "name": "Floris Bosveld"}, {"authorId": "50243191", "name": "I.

In contrast, we observed associations at only 7/32 loci previously identified in association with BMI; the majority of overlap was observed with SAT.

Evidence has accumulated that this risk is related to intrinsic differences in behavior of adipocytes in different fat depots. In the current study, we demonstrate that adipocyte precursor cells (APCs) isolated from visceral and subcutaneous white adipose depots of mice have distinct patterns of gene expression, differentiation potential, and response to environmental and genetic influences. APCs derived from subcutaneous fat differentiate well in the presence of classical induction cocktail, whereas those from visceral fat differentiate poorly but can be induced to differentiate by addition of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 or BMP-4. This difference correlates with major differences in gene expression signature between subcutaneous and visceral APCs. The number of APCs is higher in obesity-prone C57BL/6 mice than obesity-resistant 129 mice, and the number in both depots is increased by up to 270% by exposure of mice to high-fat diet. Thus, APCs from visceral and subcutaneous depots are dynamic populations, which have intrinsic differences in gene expression, differentiation properties, and responses to environmental/genetic factors.

In human subjects, areas of CH2 peaks at 2.1 and 1.3\u2009ppm were linearly correlated (slope, 0.172; r\u2009=\u20090.991), as were the 0.9\u2009ppm CH3 and 1.3\u2009ppm CH2 peaks (slope, 0.125; r\u2009=\u20090.989). The 2.75\u2009ppm CH2 peak represented 0.6% of the total fat signal in high\u2010liver\u2010fat subjects. These values predict that 8.6% of the total fat signal overlies the water peak.

We reviewed 59 papers, of which 38 (containing 86 comparisons) met eligibility criteria. Five groups of fats were evaluated: tallows, calcium salts of palm fat (Megalac, Church and Dwight Co. Inc., Princeton, NJ), oilseeds, prilled fat, and other calcium salts. Milk production responses to fats were significant, and the estimated mean difference was 1.05 kg/cow per day, but results were heterogeneous. Milk yield increased with increased difference in dry matter intake (DMI) between treatment and control groups, decreased with predicted metabolizable energy (ME) balance between these groups, and decreased with increased difference in soluble protein percentage of the diet between groups. Decreases in DMI were significant for Megalac, oilseeds, and other Ca salts, and approached significance for tallow. Feeding fat for a longer period increased DMI, as did greater differences in the amount of soluble protein percentage of the diet between control and treatment diets. Tallow, oilseeds, and other Ca salts reduced, whereas Megalac increased, milk fat percentage. Milk fat percentage effects were heterogeneous for fat source. Differences between treatment and control groups in duodenal concentrations of C18:2 and C 18:0 fatty acids and Mg percentage reduced the milk fat percentage standardized mean difference. Milk fat yield responses to fat treatments were very variable. The other Ca salts substantially decrease, and the Megalac and oilseeds increased, fat yield. Fat yield increased with increased DMI difference between groups and was lower with an increased estimated ME balance between treatment and control groups, indicating increased partitioning of fat to body tissue reserves. Feeding fats decreased milk protein percentage, but results were heterogeneous. An increased number of milkings increased the milk protein percentage, whereas the difference between the treatment and control groups in duodenal concentrations of 18:2 fatty acids and dietary Mg concentration reduced the milk protein percentage. None of the fat treatments influenced milk protein production. The range of responses to different fats fed approached or exceeded 5 standard deviations from the mean and differed in point direction for all variables studied, indicating the varied and profound biological effects of fats. Responses to fat feeding were highly heterogeneous for all variables studied and heterogeneity was present within responses to individual fat groups. The lower DMI combined with higher milk and milk fat production showed that fats could improve the efficiency of milk production.

Here, we demonstrate that several UCP1-immunoreactive brown adipocytes occurring in WAT after cold acclimatization have a mixed morphology (paucilocular adipocytes). These cells also had a mixed mitochondrioma with classic \"brown\" and \"white\" mitochondria, suggesting intermediate steps in the process of direct transformation of white into brown adipocytes (transdifferentiation). Quantitative electron microscopy disclosed that cold exposure (6 degrees C for 10 days) did not induce an increase in WAT preadipocytes. beta(3)-adrenoceptor-knockout mice had a blunted brown adipocyte occurrence upon cold acclimatization. Administration of the beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonist CL316,243 induced the occurrence of brown adipocytes, with the typical morphological features found after cold acclimatization. In contrast, administration of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor agonist xamoterol increased only the number of preadipocytes. These findings indicate that transdifferentiation depends on beta(3)-adrenoceptor activation, whereas preadipocyte recruitment is mediated by beta(1)-adrenoceptor. RT-qPCR experiments disclosed that cold exposure induced enhanced expression of the thermogenic genes and of genes expressed selectively in brown adipose tissue (iBAT) and in both interscapular BAT and WAT. beta(3)-adrenoceptor suppression blunted their expression only in WAT. Furthermore, cold acclimatization induced an increased WAT expression of the gene coding for C/EBPalpha (an antimitotic protein), whereas Ccna1 expression (related to cell proliferation) was unchanged. Overall, our data strongly suggest that the cold-induced emergence of brown adipocytes in WAT predominantly reflects beta(3)-adrenoceptor-mediated transdifferentiation.", "authors": [{"authorId": "3626375", "name": "G.

References of Included studies and reviews were also checked.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nTrials fulfilled the following criteria: 1) randomised with appropriate control group, 2) intention to reduce or modify fat or cholesterol intake (excluding exclusively omega-3 fat interventions), 3) not multi factorial, 4) adult humans with or without cardiovascular disease, 5) intervention at least six months, 6) mortality or cardiovascular morbidity data available.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nParticipant numbers experiencing health outcomes in each arm were extracted independently in duplicate and random effects meta-analyses, meta-regression, sub-grouping, sensitivity analyses and funnel plots were performed.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nThis updated review suggested that reducing saturated fat by reducing and/or modifying dietary fat reduced the risk of cardiovascular events by 14% (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.96, 24 comparisons, 65,508 participants of whom 7% had a cardiovascular event, I(2) 50%). Subgrouping suggested that this reduction in cardiovascular events was seen in studies of fat modification (not reduction - which related directly to the degree of effect on serum total and LDL cholesterol and triglycerides), of at least two years duration and in studies of men (not of women). There were no clear effects of dietary fat changes on total mortality (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.04, 71,790 participants) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.04, 65,978 participants). This did not alter with sub-grouping or sensitivity analysis.Few studies compared reduced with modified fat diets, so direct comparison was not possible.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nThe findings are suggestive of a small but potentially important reduction in cardiovascular risk on modification of dietary fat, but not reduction of total fat, in longer trials. Lifestyle advice to all those at risk of cardiovascular disease and to lower risk population groups, should continue to include permanent reduction of dietary saturated fat and partial replacement by unsaturates.

Most prior studies have focused on adipose tissue as the source of obesity-associated inflammation. Increasing evidence links intestinal bacteria to development of diet-induced obesity (DIO). This study tested the hypothesis that HF western diet and gut bacteria interact to promote intestinal inflammation, which contributes to the progression of obesity and insulin resistance. Methodology/Principal Findings Conventionally raised specific-pathogen free (CONV) and germ-free (GF) mice were given HF or low fat (LF) diet for 2\u201316 weeks. Body weight and adiposity were measured. Intestinal inflammation was assessed by evaluation of TNF-\u03b1 mRNA and activation of a NF-\u03baBEGFP reporter gene. In CONV but not GF mice, HF diet induced increases in body weight and adiposity. HF diet induced ileal TNF-\u03b1 mRNA in CONV but not GF mice and this increase preceded obesity and strongly and significantly correlated with diet induced weight gain, adiposity, plasma insulin and glucose. In CONV mice HF diet also resulted in activation of NF-\u03baBEGFP in epithelial cells, immune cells and endothelial cells of small intestine. Further experiments demonstrated that fecal slurries from CONV mice fed HF diet are sufficient to activate NF-\u03baBEGFP in GF NF-\u03baBEGFP mice. Conclusions/Significance Bacteria and HF diet interact to promote proinflammatory changes in the small intestine, which precede weight gain and obesity and show strong and significant associations with progression of obesity and development of insulin resistance. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that intestinal inflammation is an early consequence of HF diet which may contribute to obesity and associated insulin resistance.

General changes in lifestyle, including consumption of fat-rich food, are among the most important factors leading to an unprecedented increase in the prevalence of this disease. Weight gain results from an imbalance between caloric intake and energy expenditure. Both of these parameters are under the tight control of specialized neurons of the hypothalamus that respond to peripheral anorexigenic and adipostatic signals carried by leptin and insulin. Here we show, by macroarray analysis, that high-fat feeding [hyperlipidic diet (HL)] induces the expression of several proinflammatory cytokines and inflammatory responsive proteins in hypothalamus. This phenomenon is accompanied by increased activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and nuclear factor-kappaB. In addition, HL feeding leads to impaired functional and molecular activation of the insulin-signaling pathway, which is paralleled by increased serine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate-2. Intracerebroventricular treatment of HL rats with a specific inhibitor of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SP600125) restores insulin signaling and leads to a reduced caloric intake and weight loss. We conclude that HL feeding induces a local proinflammatory status in the hypothalamus, which results in impaired anorexigenic insulin signaling.", "authors": [{"authorId": "133751305", "name": "C.

IMF content varies between species, between breeds and between muscle types in the same breed. Other factors are involved in the variation of IMF content in animals, including gender, age and feeding. Variability in IMF content is mainly linked to the number and size of intramuscular adipocytes. The accretion rate of IMF depends on the muscle growth rate. For instance, animals having a high muscularity with a high glycolytic activity display a reduced development of IMF. This suggests that muscle cells and adipocytes interplay during growth. In addition, early events that influence adipogenesis inside the muscle (i.e proliferation and differentiation of adipose cells, the connective structure embedding adipocytes) might be involved in interindividual differences in IMF content. Increasing muscularity will also dilute the final fat content of muscle. At the metabolic level, IMF content results from the balance between uptake, synthesis and degradation of triacylglycerols, which involve many metabolic pathways in both adipocytes and myofibres. Various experiments revealed an association between IMF level and the muscle content in adipocyte-type fatty acid-binding protein, the activities of oxidative enzymes, or the delta-6-desaturase level; however, other studies failed to confirm such relationships. This might be due to the importance of fatty acid fluxes that is likely to be responsible for variability in IMF content during the postnatal period rather than the control of one single pathway. This is evident in the muscle of most fish species in which triacylglycerol synthesis is almost zero. Genetic approaches for increasing IMF have been focused on live animal ultrasound to derive estimated breeding values. More recently, efforts have concentrated on discovering DNA markers that change the distribution of fat in the body (i.e. towards IMF at the expense of the carcass fatness). Thanks to the exhaustive nature of genomics (transcriptomics and proteomics), our knowledge on fat accumulation in muscles is now being underpinned. Metabolic specificities of intramuscular adipocytes have also been demonstrated, as compared to other depots. Nutritional manipulation of IMF independently from body fat depots has proved to be more difficult to achieve than genetic strategies to have lipid deposition dependent of adipose tissue location. In addition, the biological mechanisms that explain the variability of IMF content differ between genetic and nutritional factors. The nutritional regulation of IMF also differs between ruminants, monogastrics and fish due to their digestive and nutritional particularities.", "authors": [{"authorId": "4278016", "name": "J.

This expert panel reviewed the evidence and reached the following conclusions: the evidence from epidemiologic, clinical, and mechanistic studies is consistent in finding that the risk of CHD is reduced when SFAs are replaced with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). In populations who consume a Western diet, the replacement of 1% of energy from SFAs with PUFAs lowers LDL cholesterol and is likely to produce a reduction in CHD incidence of \u22652-3%. No clear benefit of substituting carbohydrates for SFAs has been shown, although there might be a benefit if the carbohydrate is unrefined and has a low glycemic index. Insufficient evidence exists to judge the effect on CHD risk of replacing SFAs with MUFAs. No clear association between SFA intake relative to refined carbohydrates and the risk of insulin resistance and diabetes has been shown. The effect of diet on a single biomarker is insufficient evidence to assess CHD risk. The combination of multiple biomarkers and the use of clinical endpoints could help substantiate the effects on CHD. Furthermore, the effect of particular foods on CHD cannot be predicted solely by their content of total SFAs because individual SFAs may have different cardiovascular effects and major SFA food sources contain other constituents that could influence CHD risk. Research is needed to clarify the role of SFAs compared with specific forms of carbohydrates in CHD risk and to compare specific foods with appropriate alternatives.", "authors": [{"authorId": "47518061", "name": "A.

Exercise therapy is an integral component of obesity management, but the most potent exercise prescription for VAT benefit is unclear. We aimed to evaluate the independent and synergistic effects of aerobic exercise (AEx) and progressive resistance training (PRT) and to directly compare the efficacy of AEx and PRT for beneficial VAT modulation. A systematic review and meta\u2010analysis was performed to assess the efficacy of exercise interventions on VAT content/volume in overweight and obese adults. Relevant databases were searched to November 2010. Included studies were randomized controlled designs in which AEx or PRT in isolation or combination were employed for 4 weeks or more in adult humans, where computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used for quantification of VAT pre\u2010 and post\u2010intervention. Of the 12196 studies from the initial search, 35 were included. After removal of outliers, there was a significant pooled effect size (ES) for the comparison between AEx therapy and control (\u22120.33, 95% CI: \u22120.52 to \u22120.14; P\u2003<\u20030.01) but not for the comparison between PRT therapy and control (0.09, 95% CI: \u22120.17 to \u22120.36; P\u2003=\u20030.49). Of the available nine studies which directly compared AEx with PRT, the pooled ES did not reach statistical significance (ES\u2003=\u20030.23, 95% CI: \u22120.02 to 0.50; P\u2003=\u20030.07 favouring AEx).

These data suggest that aerobic exercise is central for exercise programmes aimed at reducing VAT, and that aerobic exercise below current recommendations for overweight/obesity management may be sufficient for beneficial VAT modification.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We conducted a comparison study of the developed equation with many other anthropometric indices regarding its correlation with actual BF% in a large cohort of 6,510 white subjects from both sexes (67% female) representing a wide range of ages (18\u201380 years) and adiposity. Additionally, a validation study in a separate cohort (n = 1,149) and a further analysis of the clinical usefulness of this prediction equation regarding its association with cardiometabolic risk factors (n = 634) was carried out. RESULTS The mean BF% in the cohort of 6,510 subjects determined by air displacement plethysmography was 39.9 \u00b1 10.1%, and the mean BF% estimated by the CUN-BAE was 39.3 \u00b1 8.9% (SE of the estimate, 4.66%). In this group, BF% calculated with the CUN-BAE showed the highest correlation with actual BF% (r = 0.89, P < 0.000001) compared with other anthropometric measures or BF% estimators. Similar agreement was found in the validation sample. Moreover, BF% estimated by the CUN-BAE exhibits, in general, better correlations with cardiometabolic risk factors than BMI as well as waist circumference in the subset of 634 subjects. CONCLUSIONS CUN-BAE is an easy-to-apply predictive equation that may be used as a first screening tool in clinical practice.

Obesity, arising from an imbalance of energy intake and expenditure, can be driven by the ingestion of palatable [high fat (HF), high sugar], energy-dense foods. Dopamine and opioid circuitry are neural substrates associated with reward that can affect animals' preference for palatable foods. Using a mouse model, the long-term effect of maternal consumption of a HF diet on dopamine and opioid gene expression within the mesocorticolimbic reward circuitry and hypothalamus of the offspring was investigated. Mice from dams fed a HF diet during pregnancy and lactation showed an increased preference for sucrose and fat. Gene expression, measured using quantitative real-time PCR, revealed a significant approximately 3- to 10-fold up-regulation of dopamine reuptake transporter (DAT) in the ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens, and prefrontal cortex and a down-regulation of DAT in the hypothalamus. Additionally, expression of both \u03bc-opioid receptor (MOR) and preproenkephalin (PENK) was increased in nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex, and hypothalamus of mice from dams that consumed the HF diet. Epigenetic mechanisms have been associated with long-term programming of gene expression after various in utero insults. We observed global and gene-specific (DAT, MOR, and PENK) promoter DNA hypomethylation in the brains of offspring from dams that consumed the HF diet.

In the present study, we compared the metabolic consequences of HF feeding on GF and conventional (conv) C57BL/6J mice. GF mice consumed fewer calories, excreted more fecal lipids, and weighed significantly less than conv mice. GF/HF animals also showed enhanced insulin sensitivity with improved glucose tolerance, reduced fasting and nonfasting insulinemia, and increased phospho-Akt((Ser-473)) in adipose tissue. In association with enhanced insulin sensitivity, GF/HF mice had reduced plasma TNF-\u03b1 and total serum amyloid A concentrations. Reduced hypercholesterolemia, a moderate accretion of hepatic cholesterol, and an increase in fecal cholesterol excretion suggest an altered cholesterol metabolism in GF/HF mice. Pronounced nucleus SREBP2 proteins and up-regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis genes indicate that enhanced cholesterol biosynthesis contributed to the cholesterol homeostasis in GF/HF mice.

Oils with a higher degree of unsaturation were shown to produce harder gels. Oleogels containing ethylcellulose of three molecular weights and reduced polymer concentrations from 4-10% ethylcellulose were also tested using the back extrusion technique, resulting in an increase in gel strength as polymer concentration and molecular weight increased. Therefore, oleogel strength was shown to be dependant on polymer molecular weight, concentration, and the fatty acid composition of the vegetable oil.

Because bile secretion increases on a high-fat diet and bile acids generally have strong antimicrobial activity, we speculated that bile acids would be a determinant of the gut microbiota in response to a high-fat diet. The observed changes in the rat cecal microbiota triggered by cholic acid (the most abundant bile acid in human biliary bile) administration resemble those found in animals fed high-fat diets. Here, we discuss the rationale for this hypothesis by evaluating reported diet-induced gut microbiota alterations based on the postulate that bile acids worked as an underlying determinant. The identification of host factors determining the gut microbiota greatly contributes to understanding the causal relationships between changes in the gut microbiota and disease development, which remain to be elucidated.", "authors": [{"authorId": "5095085", "name": "A.

The authors, including special contributions from health and obesity experts Marc Suhrcke, Tim Lobstein, Donald Kenkel and Francesco Branca, challenge the perception that explanations for the obesity epidemic are simple and solutions are within reach. A detailed look at the data reveals a more complicated picture, one in which even finding objective evidence on the phenomenon is a difficult task. This important book examines the scale and characteristics of the epidemic, the respective roles and influence of market forces and governments, and the impact of interventions. It argues that efforts to prevent obesity and related chronic diseases can provide the means to increase social welfare and enhance health equity, relative to a situation in which chronic diseases are simply treated once they emerge. It outlines an economic approach to the prevention of chronic diseases that provides novel insights relative to a more traditional public health approach. Policy makers, health professionals and academics in public and social policy, as well as health economists who are trying to understand the epidemic and devise an effective strategy to counter it, will find this a vital resource.", "authors": [{"authorId": "5809840", "name": "F.

Normal weight was defined as a body mass index (BMI; in kg/m(2)) of 19 to <25, overweight as a BMI of 25 to <30, and obese as a BMI of \u226530. Carbohydrate, fat, and protein intakes were obtained by dietary recall. Regression analyses were adjusted for potential confounders.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe prevalence of obesity increased from 11.9% to 33.4% in men and from 16.6% to 36.5% in women. The percentage of energy from carbohydrates increased from 44.0% to 48.7%, the percentage of energy from fat decreased from 36.6% to 33.7%, and the percentage of energy from protein decreased from 16.5% to 15.7%. Trends were identical across normal-weight, overweight, and obese groups. Energy intake increased substantially in all 3 BMI groups. In NHANES 2005-2006, a 1% increase in the percentage of energy from protein was associated with a decrease in energy intake of 32 kcal (substituted for carbohydrates) or 51 kcal (substituted for fat). Similar findings were seen across all BMI categories, in men and women, and in NHANES I.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nEnergy intake and the prevalence of obesity have increased dramatically. Dietary interventions should focus on decreasing energy intake and potentially by substituting protein for fat or carbohydrates.", "authors": [{"authorId": "4752996", "name": "G.

To elucidate the unexpected coexistence of adiposity with improved insulin sensitivity and extended longevity, we examined effects of surgical removal of visceral (epididymal and perinephric) fat on metabolic traits related to insulin signaling and longevity. Comparison of results obtained in GHRKO mice and in normal animals from the same strain revealed disparate effects of visceral fat removal (VFR) on insulin and glucose tolerance, adiponectin levels, accumulation of ectopic fat, phosphorylation of insulin signaling intermediates, body temperature, and respiratory quotient (RQ). Overall, VFR produced the expected improvements in insulin sensitivity and reduced body temperature and RQ in normal mice and had opposite effects in GHRKO mice. Some of the examined parameters were altered by VFR in opposite directions in GHRKO and normal mice, and others were affected in only one genotype or exhibited significant genotype\u2003\u00d7\u2003treatment interactions. Functional differences between visceral fat of GHRKO and normal mice were confirmed by measurements of adipokine secretion, lipolysis, and expression of genes related to fat metabolism. We conclude that in the absence of GH signaling, the secretory activity of visceral fat is profoundly altered and unexpectedly promotes enhanced insulin sensitivity. The apparent beneficial effects of visceral fat in GHRKO mice may also explain why reducing adiposity by calorie restriction fails to improve insulin signaling or further extend longevity in these animals.", "authors": [{"authorId": "4835876", "name": "M.
